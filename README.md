# SASPoint5Distribution
 
This distribution is a special case of a stable distribution with shape parameter &alpha; = 1/2 and skewness parameter &beta; = 0.  
And it does not appear to be widely used.  
*This name "S&alpha;S point5 distribution" is not official but provisional.*

Such a distribution with &beta; = 0 is called symmetric alpha-stable distribution.  
- &alpha; = 2: Normal distribution
- &alpha; = 1: Cauchy distribution

The S&alpha;S point5 distribution, like these distribution, has a closed-from expression, but it can't be expressed in terms of elementary function.

## Definition
The S&alpha;S point5 distribution, generalized to a stable distribution by introducing position and scale parameters, is as follows:

Since scaling and translations allow for standardization, standard parameters are discussed here.

## Numerical Evaluation
Using fresnel integral function, it's obtained as follows:  
This equation becames difficult to obtain accurately when x is extremely small.

When x is **extremely** small, the following series expression can also be used:

When x is large, the following equation can be used as an asymptotic expression.  
The coefficients decay rapidly, making them suitable numerical evaluation:
